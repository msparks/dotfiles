# ms's dotfiles

This is my repository of configuration files for the programs I use on many
different systems.

The format of this repository is optimized for use with
[`yadm`](https://yadm.io). Install with:

```
yadm clone https://github.com/msparks/dotfiles.git
```

Or, if you're me:

```
yadm clone git@github.com:msparks/dotfiles.git
```
